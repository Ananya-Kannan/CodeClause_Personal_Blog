                                    <h3>What is Bharatanatyam?</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>Bharatanatyam is the pinnacle of Indian classical dance that brings together music, art, and movement through the lens of storytelling. Formerly known as sādir up until the 1930s, Bharatanatyam is the most well-known Indian classical dance form practised in India today according to Janet O'Shea, professor in the Department of World Arts and Culture/Dance at UCLA. The idiom hails from Tamil Nadu and Madras State in Southern India, with roots in Tanjore temple dancing performed by dēvadāsis (translated as “servants of god”) as stated by internationally acclaimed Indian classical dance artist, Rajika Puri. Building upon the legacy of dēvadāsis, Bharatanatyam training methods, audiences, performance settings, gender norms, and dancers' status is recontextualized throughout shifting historical contexts of colonialism and the post-colonial era. Intricately tied to Hindu devotionals, Bharatanatyam can be subject to presenting a narrow conception of Hinduism equated with glorified notions of Indian nationalism. In light of contemporary issues and phenomena, Bharatanatyam's strong sense of origin and tradition is enriched by modern-day content. The form's structure allows for artistry that stays true to conventional practices while fluidly interspersing artistic freedom that has pushed the form into an ever-evolving craft. Serving as a mirror to past traditions yet a window into the future of endless possibility, Bharatanatyam's trajectory of infinite development draws upon its rich history while present-day artists mould the form to ensure relevancy and progression.</p>
 
                                    <h3>Key Features of Bharatanatyam </h3>

                                    <p>A Bharatanatyam dancer's costume consists of six yards of hand-woven silk accompanied by a minimum of ten pieces of gold jewellery. The dancer's hair is braided down the back with a brightly-coloured tassel attached at the end and twisted in a chignon encircled with flowers. A 2 brooch-like ornament called the Chandra (moon) and sūrya (sun) is worn on either side of the head. The dancer wears a strand of bells around their ankles which can be heard as the dancer's bare feet hit the bare floor of the stage. Make-up for a Bharatanatyam dancer consists of “heavily-kohled eyes, darkened eye-brows and lipstick as well as the red tilaka (spot) placed at the centre of the forehead” - a sign of a Hindu married woman. Dancers' hands and feet are covered in henna which is a red dye used to paint intricate designs on the skin - a symbolic characteristic of a bride at her wedding. Although this costuming and make-up are known all throughout India to be associated with Bharatanatyam dancers, it also resembles the dress of a typical South Indian bride and is considered to be the most ornate costume a woman wears during her lifetime. A Bharatanatyam performer's costume is reflective of the normal clothing worn by dēvadāsis who became the bride of the deity.</p>

                                    <p> In addition to costuming, some other key features of Bharatanatyam include mudras (hand gestures), facial expressions set to rhythmic cadences, the portrayal of Hindu deities, and miming elements as specified by Dr Katherine Zubko. This south Indian dance form draws upon a “semiotic lexicon” that brings to life well-known Hindu mythological stories as well as other tales of the choreographer's choosing. The lack of scenery on stage complies with the conventions of Sanskrit theatre where the performer is expected to suggest changes of scenery or objects through skilful use of hand gestures. Although Bharatanatyam comes from devotional dancing, contemporary artists create a vast range of work including both secular and non-secular pieces. A primarily solo dance form, Bharatanatyam's repertoire and vocabulary are subdivided by nritta (abstract rhythmic choreography) and abhinaya (dramatic dance). Both abhinaya and nritta are included in the word, Natya, the term closest to the idea of “dance” in India. “Abhinaya,” writes Rajika Puri, “refers to the mime element of dances in which facial 3 expressions and hand gestures, in particular, are used to convey, dramatic, narrative, and spoken language meanings.” Bharatanatyam is a combination of dancing and acting that allows the dancer to flow seamlessly between multiple identities. It is common for dancers to assume a stance where the knees are bent and the legs rotated outward, showcasing the grounded use of weight and gracefully erect and floating torso looming above dynamic feet. Scholar of Indian classical dance, Kapila Vatsyayan, states that “Dance interprets in movement, what music interprets in sound; the postures and the stances it attains are the poses which the sculptor models; all these the dancer imbues with a living spirit of the movement in a composition of form which is both sensuous and spiritual.” Bharatanatyam conveys a unique crossroads of artistic expression that enlivens viewers and demands a thorough understanding of the body's relation to sound from its practitioners. </p>
                                    
                                    <h3>Contemporary Artists and Issues: Fusion of Past and Present</h3>

                                    <p>Due to shifting historical contexts, post-colonial frameworks, and pioneers of the form, Bharatanatyam has undergone tremendous developments while still managing to stay true to its cultural origins. With roots in ancient Sanskrit literature and a foundation in the devotional dancing of the dēvadāsis, Bharatanatyam's lineage is linked to longstanding traditions. Bharatanatyam's far-reaching diaspora and international acclaim have enabled it to become a respected global art. Modern-day practitioners are widely attempting to fuse the traditional with the modern to ensure Bharatanatyam remains a relevant, vibrant art form. Those who have found success in this fusion of past and present express originality by showing fidelity to the past, utilizing key features of Bharatanatyam and in doing so, tapping into the vast range of possibilities. Although it may be reflective of the past, as all art owes its origins and pioneers much credit, Bharatanatyam also displays promise to future practitioners because of its transformative essence. How can we ignite Bharatanatyam's healing modalities at a time when the world desperately needs to feel whole? There will always be stories to tell, and the beauty of Bharatanatyam lies in its ability to convey the trials and tribulations of humanity, no matter the era.</p>
